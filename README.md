# CDP1802 ("COSMAC") Simulator

The CDP1802 microprocessor was the basis of many early hobbyist
microcomputers, including the COSMAC ELF and the "EFA4" computer
described in the Swedish book "Elektronik f√∂r alla, del 4". More
recently in 2010, a new hobbyist microcomputer kit called the "1802
Membership Card" was introduced by Lee Hart.

This repository contains a simulator for the CDP1802 microprocessor
written in Java. So far it is not complete, but merely a hobby
project.

The code can be compiled using the included Eclipse project. The main
class to run is `se.raek.cdp1802.gui.Tiny`.
